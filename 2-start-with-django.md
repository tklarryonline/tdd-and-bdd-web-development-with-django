# Get started with Django

Django (/ˈdʒæŋɡoʊ/ jang-goh) is a free and open source web application framework written in Python. A web framework is a set of components that helps you to develop websites faster and easier.

## Our preferred project layout

Django developers have different opinions about what they consider best practices in some areas. Project layout is one among those. This tutorial will present our approach, inspired by Two-scoop of Django book and arguably one of the most common ones.

Our layouts at the highest level (the repository root) are:

```
<repo_dir>/
    <django_project_root>/
        <django_configs_root>
```

Generally, here are the functions of each level:

* **`repo_dir`**: The project folder, where you initialized your Git repo.
  * Place critical components like **Readme.md**, **.gitignore**, **requirements.txt files**
  * Store important files required for deployment.
* **`django_project_root`**: The root of the actual Django project.
  * All Python code resides inside this directory. 
* **`django_configs_root`**: The Django-specific settings folder generated by `django-admin` when being used to create a project

Now, we will start implementing our Bookshelves project with our preferences above.

## Install Django

Let's start by creating your own virtualenv — say `django-bookshelves` — and activate it. Our work will be **mainly in** this virtualenv.

Then we can install Django by running:

```sh
$ pip install django
```

You can check the Django version by:

```sh
$ django-admin --version
1.9.6  # At the writing time of this tutorial
```
