# Serving the homepage, TDD style

Time to create some content! Yay!

Every web needs a homepage. Be it a blog, a fashion website, or even Twitter. In our current stage, the homepage should be pretty much a static landing page. Let's define our homepage as:

* Having a navigation bar with Bookshelves logo on the left hand side.
* Having a welcome text i.e. *"Hey there! Welcome to Bookshelves community!"*
* Having a footer with copyright information.
