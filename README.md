# TDD and BDD Web Development with Django

## Introduction

We hope that we could make you love Django and Web technologies as much as we do.

## What you will learn in this tutorial

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the creation of a basic bookshelves web application to keep track and lend books. We will show you how to put (deploy) it online for your friends to use!

Your app will consist of two parts:

* A public site letting people to keep track of their books and who borrowed them.
* An admin interface to manage the users and book categories. Admins can also view the statistical reports from the usage data.

You will also learn:

* To build your application using TDD and BDD practices.
* To control the source version using Git.
* To use CSS Frameworks to make your web application look neat without any hassle.
* To deploy your app to Heroku and show it to your friends.
